# Cyberpunk

## Introduction
Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by the Polish studio CD Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe.

## The World of Night City
Night City is the heart of Cyberpunk, characterized by its towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and diverse districts. Each area tells its own story, reflecting the socio-economic disparity of the world. From the luxurious heights of Corpo Plaza to the grim alleys of Pacifica, the city feels alive, offering countless opportunities for exploration and adventure.

## Gameplay and Customization
Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective as V, a mercenary whose voice, face, hairstyle, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. There are also five attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical Ability, and Cool) that can be customized to suit the player's gameplay style, with a sixth attribute â€” Relic, being introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion.

The gameplay is flexible: the three primary play styles are Netrunner (hacking), Engineer (machinery), and Solo (combat). There are many skills available in the game that you can use to help you defeat enemies. Some of them are presented in the table below.
