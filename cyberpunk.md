# Cyberpunk

## Introduction
Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by the Polish studio CD Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe.

## Night City
The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions: the corporate City Centre, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica (and its anarchist Dogtown section), and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these locations on foot (in first-person view) and in vehicles (in either a third- or first-person view).

## Gameplay
Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective as V, a mercenary whose voice, face, hairstyle, body type and modifications, background and clothing are customisable. There are also five attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical Ability, and Cool) that can be customized to suit the player's gameplay style, with a sixth attribute â€” Relic, being introduced in the Phantom Liberty expansion.

The gameplay is flexible: the three primary play styles are Netrunner (hacking), Engineer (machinery), and Solo (combat). There are many skills available in the game that you can use to help you defeat enemies. Some of them are presented in the table below.

## Themes and Storytelling
The game delves into themes like identity, morality, and the impact of technology on humanity. Through engaging missions and character interactions, players explore questions about power, freedom, and the consequences of unchecked corporate greed. The narrative is bolstered by compelling characters, including Johnny Silverhand, a rebel rocker played by Keanu Reeves.

## Reception
Upon release, Cyberpunk received both praise and criticism. While its storytelling and world-building were widely celebrated, technical issues at launch marred its reception. However, subsequent updates and expansions have addressed many of these problems, solidifying its place as a modern gaming classic.
